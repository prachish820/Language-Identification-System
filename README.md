# Language-Identification-System

The repository has codes to develop a LID system using Gaussian mixture 
models (GMM) and GMM-UBM (universal backgroud model).


Please refer to cs699_asgn2.pdf for details about both models and the data to be used.

MFCC_extraction_code contains code for feature extraction. It has three files. Run main.py to extract MFCC features of .wav audio files.
You can also use the extracted data using the drive link provided with code.
