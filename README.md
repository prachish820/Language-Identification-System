# Language-Identification-System

The repository has codes to develop a LID system using Gaussian mixture 
models (GMM) and GMM-UBM (universal backgroud model).


Please refer to cs699_asgn2.pdf for details about both models and the data to be used.


Install the following libraries:

csv (pip install python-csv)
librosa (pip install librosa)
numpy (pip install numpy)
matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)


MFCC_extraction_code contains three files - main.py, gmm.py and utils.py 
Run only the main.py file for extracting MFCC features of audio files in .wav format, which will be saved (in .csv format) after voice activity detection.
You can also use the extracted data using the drive link provided with code.
